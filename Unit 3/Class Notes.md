- [[Absolutism]]

	- a **political theory** in this unit
	- "A necessity as a result of the times..."
	- the 16th and 17th century were not peaceful, justified to prevent disorder

			- goal = curbing nobility's power in practice
		2. religious orthodoxy
		3. efficient bureaucracy
			- federal & regional "yes men"

		5. [[Mercantilism]]
# Justification of Absolutism
1. [[Thomas Hobbes]]
	- 17th century political theorist
	- ideas reflect the times, 17th century England tumultuous
	- [[England Civil War]]
	- a week of content (waow)
	- *Leviathan* (1651)
		- [[Absolutism]] was as absolute necessity
		- very realistic view of human nature: competitive and uncooperative
		- "Men are beasts", "Life is nasty, short, and brutish"
		- [[Social Contract]] theory
		- Strong monarch, avert anarchy
2. Theorists used religion
	- "Divine right" theorists
	- "Embodiment of God on Earth", therefore infallible
	- [[Jean Bodin]]
	- [[Jacques Bossuet]]
# Foundations of French Absolutism
- [[Henry IV]] is killed in 1610, regicide for promoting religious tolerance by Catholics
- [[Marie de Medici]] (wife) and [[Louis XIII]] (9 years old)
- Problem: 9 year old can't do much
- [[Cardinal Richelieu]]
	- advisor to [[Louis XIII]] until he came of age r. 1610-1624
	- adult rule r. 1624-1643
	- "groundwork for [[Absolutism]]"
	- Biggest Threats
		1. A "state within the state"..., [[Huguenots]], 1517-1648 Unit
		2. Also "corral" the nobility (also many Huguenots)
		- Both groups taking advantage of [[Louis XIII]]'s age
		- Dealing with problems before they occur
	- Established a beaurocracy = "The [[Intendant System]]"
		1. Divide country into administrative districts
		2. Competent & loyal administrators
# Louis XIV & Cardinal Mazarin
- [[Cardinal Richelieu]] died in 1642
- [[Louis XIII]] died in 1643

			- "Experienced & independent" armies, "ready to shift gears"
		2. *Carpe diem* mentality for nobles
		3. "Mazarin was no Richelieu"
	- Government prevailed after 4 years, however
		1. [[Louis XIV]] childhood was very traumatic
