	- [[England Civil War]]
	- a week of content (waow)
	- *Leviathan* (1651)

		- very realistic view of human nature: competitive and uncooperative
		- "Men are beasts", "Life is nasty, short, and brutish"
		- [[Social Contract]] theory
		- Strong monarch, avert anarchy
2. Theorists used religion
	- "Divine right" theorists
	- "Embodiment of God on Earth", therefore infallible
	- [[Jean Bodin]]
	- [[Jacques Bossuet]]
# Foundations of French Absolutism
- [[Henry IV]] is killed in 1610, regicide for promoting religious tolerance by Catholics
- [[Marie de Medici]] (wife) and [[Louis XIII]] (9 years old)
- Problem: 9 year old can't do much
- [[Cardinal Richelieu]]
	- advisor to [[Louis XIII]] until he came of age r. 1610-1624
	- adult rule r. 1624-1643
	- "groundwork for [[Absolutism]]"
	- Biggest Threats
		1. A "state within the state"..., [[Huguenots]], 1517-1648 Unit
		2. Also "corral" the nobility (also many Huguenots)
		- Both groups taking advantage of [[Louis XIII]]'s age
		- Dealing with problems before they occur
	- Established a beaurocracy = "The [[Intendant System]]"
		1. Divide country into administrative districts
		2. Competent & loyal administrators
