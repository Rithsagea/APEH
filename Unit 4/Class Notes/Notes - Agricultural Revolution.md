# The 2nd Agricultural Revolution
- [[2nd Agricultural Revolution]]
	- impact on economy & demographics
	- prerequisite for the Industrial Revolution
	- increased supply food, surplus precedent (first time in European History!)
	- no more widespread famines
	- demographic impact = population increase
	- `population explosion` :: trend remains for the rest of the course
		- lower death rate
	- warmer + drier climate change
	- efficiency and mechanization of agriculture -> less demand for farmers
	- urbanization :: displaced workforce migrated to cities
	- new technology + techniques
		1. `enclosure movement`
			- no more `open field` system
			- fenced parcels or hedgerows 
		2. crop rotations (`mixed farming`)
			- fallow land = inefficient
			- clover & alfalfa + grazing sheep
			- manure deposited & tilled = more fertile soil
		3. `selective breeding` of livestock
			- better breeds of oxen & sheep
		4. invention of the seed drill
