# The 2nd Agricultural Revolution
- [[2nd Agricultural Revolution]]
	- prerequisite for the Industrial Revolution
	- impact on economy & demographics
		- increased supply food, surplus precedent (first time in European History!)
		- no more widespread famines
		- demographic impact = population increase
		- `population explosion` :: trend remains for the rest of the course
			- lower death rate
	- warmer + drier climate change
	- efficiency and mechanization of agriculture -> less demand for farmers
	- urbanization :: displaced workforce migrated to cities
	- new technology + techniques
		1. `enclosure movement`
			- no more `open field` system
			- fenced parcels or hedgerows 
		2. crop rotations (`mixed farming`)
			- fallow land = inefficient
			- clover & alfalfa + grazing sheep, wheat + barley on remainder
			- manure deposited & tilled = more fertile soil
		3. `selective breeding` of livestock
			- better breeds of oxen & sheep
		4. invention of the seed drill
			- [[Jethro Tull]] (1674-1741) :: botanist / inventor
	- benefitted wealthy landowners (yeoman farmers), large tracts of land
	- now landless peasants migrated to cities
	- farming is profitable due to newfound efficiency
	- economic, demographic, & migration changes
