# French Revolution
## 1. The Estate System
- System of social stratification that existed
- For centuries before 1789
- were **legally-defined** (like America now)
- 1st Estate :: church and clergymen ~1%
- 2nd Estate :: nobility ~2%
- 3rd Estate :: literally "everyone else" ~97%
	- Bourgeoisie, doctors, *philosophes*, lawyers
	- dirty, illiterate peasants
- Historically, representatives from each Estate in the Estates-General
- 3rd representatives were bourgeoisie, 1st & 2nd didn't pay taxes, all paid by 3rd
- 1st and 2nd controlled government positions
- 3rd Estate revolted in 1789
	- France nearly bankrupt
	-  [[Louis XVI]] :: (r.1774-1792) "inherited mess"
	- few options or solutions..., makes worst decision in European History
	- convened the Estates-General, first meeting since 1614 (175 years ago)
	- indicates desperation
	- [[Louis XVI]] reform-minded in lieu of bigger problems:
		- No idea revolution would happen, historical luxury (hindsight waow)
		- [[Charles de Calonne]], finance minister
		- proposed complete fiscal overhaul
		- needed consent for taxes from "privileged estates"
		- representatives from each Estate brought... "list of grievances"
