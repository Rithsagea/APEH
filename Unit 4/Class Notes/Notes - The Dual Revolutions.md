# French Revolution Causes
## 1. The Estate System
- System of social stratification that existed
- For centuries before 1789
- were **legally-defined** (like America now)
- 1st Estate :: church and clergymen ~1%
- 2nd Estate :: nobility ~2%
- 3rd Estate :: literally "everyone else" ~97%
	- Bourgeoisie, doctors, *philosophes*, lawyers
	- dirty, illiterate peasants
- Historically, representatives from each Estate in the Estates-General
- 3rd representatives were bourgeoisie, 1st & 2nd didn't pay taxes, all paid by 3rd
- 1st and 2nd controlled government positions
- 3rd Estate revolted in 1789
	- France nearly bankrupt
	-  [[Louis XVI]] :: (r.1774-1792) "inherited mess"
	- few options or solutions..., makes worst decision in European History
	- convened the Estates-General, first meeting since 1614 (175 years ago)
	- indicates desperation
	- [[Louis XVI]] reform-minded in lieu of bigger problems:
		- No idea revolution would happen, historical luxury (hindsight waow)
		- [[Charles de Calonne]], finance minister
		- proposed complete fiscal overhaul
		- needed consent for taxes from "privileged estates"
		- representatives from each Estate brought... "list of grievances"
		- `Nothing good comes from a meeting full of angry people`
## 2. Economic
- 1640s-1780s :: "An Era of deficit spending"
- [[Louis XIV]] and Louis XV (worthless)
1. Versailles cost?
2. Standing army & warfare
3. French & Indian War (1754-1763)
4. Aid to the United States
- nearly bankrupt by 1780s, how could it get worse?
1. Bad harvests 1787 & 1788 ->
2. Increased food prices (grain)
3. Natural disasters
## 3. Philosophes
## 4. 18th Century Revolutions
# Estates General
- Beginning of the meeting of the Estates General at Versailles
- "Last stand of the Old Regime"
- 1200 representatives had been elected over weeks leading to meeting regionally
- 3rd Estate representatives were educated borgeousie, lawyers, doctors, vs illiterate peasants
- 1st issue was *how* to vote
- Historically voted "by estates" unfair
- Proposed radical idea "by head"; per capita
- debate lasted for weeks until an impasse
## Tennis Court Oath
- Meeting took unforeseen turn
- 3rd Estate realized that they were being ignored & voting was worthless
- Formed the National Assembly (only members of the 3rd Estate)
- morning, June 20th, "mysteriously" locked out of their meeting room
- Found room (indoor tennis court)
- pledged an oath not to disband until they had a constitution
- immortalized by the iconic artist, [[Jacques-Louis David]]
	- preeminent artist of The French Revolution
	- Neoclassical Art = Reverence for civic duty & patriotism
	- relates to Greco-Roman virtue, civic duty, & patriotism
	- *The Oath of the Horatii* 1784, 5 years before everything starts
