# Tangents
- Francis; Monday, he discovered the AI is taking over the world rant; just said, oh hey look, Caligula!
- Kids are moving around
- why is this year the last
- haha progress reports; guidance releases them like a mushroom cloud
- people have children to shovel snow; Fusco shovels snow himself, have him talk to his kids; is it wrong to say hey, you could be getting some angry parent emails if I agitate too many people; is it wrong to say, `out of the box herd swag`?
- someone's pen died during LEQ last year, dip into trust funds and buy some black pens, someone was crying "that doesn't help", just ignored them and told him to shut up; I'll get a shovel and go bury it for you
- AP test comes in May, needs to rush
- say some things in quotes to kids, "competent", "student", (it's funny because they're not)
- if you plagiarize in college, you get kicked out; you get refund obviously \\s; UVA students, plagiarizinng student allowed to stay in school, because student jury said so; just like Stalin, they were always convicted :D
- Soviet propoganda nailed to trees in township
- parents in a fit of anger at some point, `we don't love you`, next day when they calm down and say `I don't mean that`, can't take that back, unless some science thing do something to your mind
- Waterloo is close to Flander's Field, go to San Francisco, put some poppies in your hair; Belgium, underappreciated country, WWI
- Francis before this class; what level of underappreciated today; everyone treated on a quiz, got upset people cheated on a canvas quiz; leaves the classroom during quizzes
- Terzis not going to show `The Breakfast Club`, too much stuff being cut out
- Ziccardi known for more than a year; chipping away at TODO list from gdoc, ruin childhood, it's not that hard case in point; *Willy Wonka* is about Marxism
- Francis, toupperware, eats food, forgot to bring squirrel in; shakes it everyday and asks people to guess what it is; need to bring WWII mess kit teriyaki squirrel
- Something is important because the font is bigger
- We learned that kids are dirty rotten scoundrels in World; Versaille Treaty, it was 3, then Italians were there; Italians were always important in European History, only brought up to make fun of them
- US1 kids never learned about WWI, had to explain why maps switched (Italy switched sides); thought they would get stuff for contributing; got nothing
- know some parents on a first name basis; therapy docs; don't trust anyone who rides scooter around school, or wears tie-die; or allegedly cheats
- can't go I'm sure you went over it in APULL
- Seniors last year had them for World Cultures, this place was a popsicle stand not a school; made a mistake, didn't know audience; sarcasm went over their head, discussing WW3 while studying for finals (???) gave out a review sheet; 3 weeks before final, on canvas, massive PDF; kid came in next day and complained the review sheet was too big; I am as counsel advising you to do the review sheet; kid got 38% on final; need to staple the scantron to the wall; didn't get any angry parent emails, only angry at kid cuz they didn't study; might have had an impact, since final is 10% of final grade
- Henry Kissinger, wrote dissertationi on the Congress of Vienna (he's still alive at 99)
- walked into lab, was at the same Metallica concert as some student's dad in '93, what happened to you, he's cool like I am
- rewatch movie and think about how concerning Grandpa Joe was (Willy Wonky) he's a scam artist, gets up and does a dance; almost gets Charlie decapitated having him drink something; don't trust old people
- someone probably has lickable wallpaper, right next to where the butler sits
- it's cold in this one area, probably because sitting in front of a piece of plexy glass, not an insulator (not to get into physics); all the windows are plastic!; those windows are from the Eisenhower administration, when they built this school; `I'm having a moment, don't interrupt!`; didn't always have air conditioning; big upgrade, not to give Frank credit; air conditioning
- student :: look, another book to read!; can't take books out of week, kids thought Ziccardi was a librarian (he isn't one); had study hall in the library, sat at the circulation desk, hated kids so sat far away; one of the freshman tried to check out book, go to office and see if they can help you; never saw kid again, probably lost in the woods
- passed US1 class last year
- oh my gosh, you only got me a new Honda? next day open the garage and only a tricycle, don't complain
- notorious, like me, in the school; random freshman say hello to me; I have your trading card! can you autograph this? sit for id photos, little photographs are there electronically, like kids who are all wearing the same blue-rimmed glasses
- school used to have respect; now it's not good
- i'm bugging, kid said that when they were failing a test last week; I don't speak gang! child
- Europe loves to split up countries
- last year went over Soviet puppet states, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Monacco \\s; check to see if people are listening; World kids listen, don't need to bury pens, don't let people use computers on assessments; were in a little different situation last year
- *starts aggressively listing random people and events*
- Christmas Movie :: what's the plot? there is no plot; it's the best, worst movie
- Soviet intervention is always a positive thing! Red army shows up \\s
- parents making vague threats, if you do something...; do it anyways, nothing happens regardless, 0 respect
- Ottomans randomly appear everywhere, they are there and they aren't good; in World they are actually people
